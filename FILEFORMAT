This is the platform independent 'LuaDesk Paquet' file format that LuaDesk offers. The LuaDesk executable has an embedded script that creates this packed file using itself as a base. All TOC integers are stored in network order. To create a paquet from your own Lua scripts (plaintext or compiled), simple run the LuaDesk executable and follow the prompts.
